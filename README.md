# Real-Time-Stock-MarketAnalysis
Stock Market Analysis with Real Time Streaming using Apache Kafka
# 📈 Real-Time Stock Market Analysis with Apache Kafka

This project implements a real-time stock market analysis pipeline using **Apache Kafka** for streaming data. It features **Bollinger Bands** for generating buy/sell signals and conducts **trend and seasonality analysis** on incoming stock price data.

## 🚀 Overview

The system is designed to ingest real-time stock data, process it through analytical modules, and visualize key financial indicators such as:
- 📉 Bollinger Bands (for identifying trading signals)
- 🔄 Seasonality and Trend patterns
- 📊 Real-time data visualization

The goal is to provide near real-time insights for stock traders or analysts by leveraging Kafka's event-streaming capabilities.

## 🛠️ Features

- Real-time data ingestion using **Apache Kafka**
- Technical analysis using Bollinger Bands
- Time series analysis for detecting trends and seasonality
- Live visualizations and signal updates
- Modular and extensible pipeline design
